## Issues Found

### 1. Minor: Missing Package Reference

**Location**: `architecture/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`

**Issue**: Documentation mentions `packages/telemetry/` but this directory doesn't exist in the workspace.

**Impact**: Low - doesn't affect functionality, just documentation accuracy

**Recommendation**: Remove reference to `packages/telemetry/` or create the package if it's planned.

**Fix**:

```markdown
# In PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md, update:

packages/ # Shared packages
├── shared/ # Shared types/schemas
└── config/ # Build/lint/test config

# Remove: └── telemetry/ # Logging/metrics utilities
```

## Recommendations

### 1. Keep Documentation Updated ✅

The documentation is currently excellent. To maintain this:

- Update docs when making code changes
- Review docs during PR process
- Run periodic audits (quarterly)

### 2. Add Missing Sections (Optional)

Consider adding documentation for:

- **Testing Guide**: How to write and run tests
- **Deployment Guide**: Step-by-step deployment process
- **Contributing Guide**: How to contribute to the project
- **API Reference**: Complete API endpoint documentation

### 3. Fix Minor Issue

Update `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` to remove reference to non-existent `packages/telemetry/`.
